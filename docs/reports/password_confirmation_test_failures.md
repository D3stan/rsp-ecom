# Password Confirmation Test Failures Report

## Issue

The `password can be confirmed` test in `tests/Feature/Auth/PasswordConfirmationTest.php` is failing with a 500 error when the CSRF middleware is disabled.

## Analysis

The test is failing with a 500 error, which indicates a server error. The log file shows a `RuntimeException: Session store not set on request.` error. This is because the `WithoutMiddleware` trait disables all middleware, including the session middleware, which is required for the test to pass.

## Proposed Solution

The CSRF token needs to be handled correctly in the test environment. I have tried to disable the CSRF middleware, but this is causing other issues.

I recommend investigating how to correctly handle the CSRF token in the test environment. This might involve adding the token to the request headers or disabling the middleware in a different way.

It is also possible that the issue is with the test environment itself. The `phpunit.xml` file is configured to use an in-memory SQLite database, but it is possible that the session is not being handled correctly in this environment.
