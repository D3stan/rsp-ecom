# Authentication Test Failures Report

## Issue

The authentication tests in `tests/Feature/Auth/AuthenticationTest.php` are failing. The `users can authenticate using the login screen` test fails to authenticate the user, and the `users can logout` test fails to log the user out.

## Analysis

The tests are failing with authentication errors, even after resolving the CSRF token issues. This suggests that there might be a problem with the authentication logic itself, or with how the session is being handled in the test environment.

The `login screen can be rendered` and `users can not authenticate with invalid password` tests are passing, which means that the routes are correct and the application is able to handle invalid login attempts.

## Proposed Solution

The authentication logic in `app/Http/Controllers/Auth/AuthenticatedSessionController.php` should be reviewed to ensure that it is correctly authenticating and logging out users.

Specifically, the `store` and `destroy` methods should be checked to see if they are correctly handling the session.

It is also possible that the issue is with the test environment itself. The `phpunit.xml` file is configured to use an in-memory SQLite database, but it is possible that the session is not being handled correctly in this environment.

I recommend reviewing the `AuthenticatedSessionController` and the session configuration for the test environment to resolve this issue.
