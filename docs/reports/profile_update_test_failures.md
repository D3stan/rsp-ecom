# Profile Update Test Failures Report

## Issue

The profile update tests in `tests/Feature/Settings/ProfileUpdateTest.php` are failing with a 419 error.

## Analysis

The tests are failing with a 419 error, which indicates a CSRF token mismatch. I have tried to disable the CSRF middleware in the tests, but this is not working as expected.

This is likely a problem with the application code, not the test. The `withoutMiddleware` call was added to the tests to resolve the CSRF token issue, but the tests are still failing.

## Proposed Solution

The CSRF token needs to be handled correctly in the test environment. I have tried to disable the CSRF middleware, but this is not working as expected.

I recommend investigating how to correctly handle the CSRF token in the test environment. This might involve adding the token to the request headers or disabling the middleware in a different way.

It is also possible that the issue is with the test environment itself. The `phpunit.xml` file is configured to use an in-memory SQLite database, but it is possible that the session is not being handled correctly in this environment.
