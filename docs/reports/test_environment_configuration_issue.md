# Test Environment Configuration Issue Report

## Issue

The tests are failing with database connection errors, even though the `phpunit.xml` file is correctly configured to use an in-memory SQLite database.

## Analysis

The tests are trying to connect to a MySQL database, which is the configuration in the `.env` file. This indicates that the test environment is not respecting the configuration in `phpunit.xml`.

This usually happens when the configuration is cached. The configuration cache needs to be cleared for the changes in `phpunit.xml` to take effect.

## Proposed Solution

The configuration cache needs to be cleared by running the following command:

```bash
php artisan config:clear
```

After clearing the cache, the tests should run correctly with the in-memory SQLite database.
