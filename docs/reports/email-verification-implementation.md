# Email Verification Implementation

## Overview

This implementation provides **mandatory email verification** for user registration, ensuring that users cannot create accounts or access protected features without verifying their email address.

## Key Features

### 🔒 Secure Registration Flow
- Users are **not** created in the database until email verification
- Registration creates a `PendingUserVerification` record instead
- Email verification is **mandatory** - no bypassing allowed
- Google authentication properly handles existing pending verifications

### 📧 Minimal Email Design
- Follows the same clean, minimal style as order confirmation emails
- Black and white theme with minimal branding
- Mobile-responsive design
- Clear call-to-action button

### 🛡️ Security Features
- Signed URLs with 24-hour expiration
- Unique verification tokens
- Rate limiting on resend attempts
- Automatic cleanup of expired verifications
- Protection against duplicate registrations

### 🔄 User Experience
- Clear feedback during registration process
- Pending verification status page
- Email resend functionality with cooldown
- **Automatic page refresh when verification completed from another device**
- Real-time verification status polling
- Seamless integration with Google authentication
- Helpful error messages and guidance
- Page visibility optimization (pauses polling when tab is hidden)

## Implementation Details

### Database Schema

**PendingUserVerifications Table:**
```sql
- id (primary key)
- name (string)
- email (string, unique)
- password (hashed)
- verification_token (string, unique)
- token_expires_at (timestamp)
- created_at/updated_at (timestamps)
```

### User Flow

1. **Registration Attempt**
   - User submits registration form
   - System validates email isn't already registered (User or PendingUserVerification)
   - Creates `PendingUserVerification` record
   - Sends verification email
   - Redirects to verification pending page

2. **Email Verification**
   - User clicks verification link in email
   - System validates token and expiration
   - Creates verified `User` record
   - Deletes `PendingUserVerification` record
   - Logs user in and redirects to dashboard
   - **Auto-reload mechanism updates any open verification pages**

3. **Expired Tokens**
   - Users can request new verification email
   - System regenerates token with new 24h expiration
   - Old tokens become invalid

### Protected Routes

The following routes now require email verification (`verified` middleware):

- `/checkout/*` (all authenticated checkout routes)
- `/dashboard` (user dashboard)
- `/admin/*` (admin panel)

### Google Authentication Integration

- Automatically verifies email for Google accounts
- Handles users with pending verifications
- Creates user with both Google ID and original password
- Provides seamless verification experience

## Commands

### Check Pending Verifications
```bash
# Overview of all pending verifications
php artisan auth:pending-status

# Check specific email
php artisan auth:pending-status --email=user@example.com
```

### Cleanup Expired Verifications
```bash
# Manual cleanup with confirmation
php artisan auth:cleanup-pending

# Force cleanup without confirmation
php artisan auth:cleanup-pending --force
```

### Send Test Verification Email
```bash
php artisan auth:test-verification user@example.com
```

## Automatic Maintenance

- **Daily cleanup**: Expired verifications are automatically removed at 3:00 AM
- **Scheduled task**: Configured in `app/Console/Kernel.php`

    ->name('verification.pending');

Route::get('verification/verify/{token}/{email}', [PendingUserVerificationController::class, 'verify'])
    ->middleware(['signed', 'throttle:6,1'])
    ->name('verification.verify.pending');

Route::post('verification/resend', [PendingUserVerificationController::class, 'resend'])
    ->middleware('throttle:6,1')
    ->name('verification.resend.pending');

Route::get('verification/status', [VerificationStatusController::class, 'checkStatus'])
    ->middleware('throttle:60,1')
    ->name('verification.status');
```

## Testing

Comprehensive test suite covering:
- Registration flow creating pending verifications
- Email sending and content validation
- Verification link functionality
- Expired token handling
- Resend functionality
- Google authentication integration
- Cleanup commands
- **Auto-reload API endpoints**
- **Real-time verification status checking**

## Auto-Reload Implementation

### Real-Time Verification Status
The verification pending page includes a sophisticated polling mechanism that automatically detects when verification is completed from another device:

**Polling Strategy:**
- Checks verification status every 3 seconds
- Pauses polling when browser tab is hidden (saves resources)
- Resumes polling when tab becomes visible again
- Automatically stops polling when verification is complete

**Status API Endpoint:**
```
GET /verification/status?email={email}
```

**Response Types:**
```json
// Still pending
{
  "verified": false,
  "pending": true,
  "expires_at": "2024-08-13T14:30:00.000Z"
}

// Verification completed
{
  "verified": true,
  "user_id": 123,
  "redirect_url": "/dashboard"
}

// Token expired
{
  "verified": false,
  "expired": true,
  "message": "Verification link has expired. Please request a new one."
}
```

**User Experience:**
1. User opens verification pending page on Device A
2. User opens email and clicks verification link on Device B
3. Verification completes and user is logged in on Device B
4. Device A automatically detects completion within 3 seconds
5. Device A shows success message and redirects to dashboard

This creates a seamless cross-device verification experience.

## Security Considerations

1. **No User Creation Until Verification**: Users don't exist in the database until verified
2. **Signed URLs**: Verification links are cryptographically signed
3. **Time-based Expiration**: 24-hour token lifetime
4. **Rate Limiting**: Prevents email spam and abuse
5. **Unique Tokens**: Each verification uses a unique 64-character token
6. **Automatic Cleanup**: Prevents database bloat from abandoned registrations

## Future Enhancements (Proposed)

### UX Improvements
1. **Progress Indicator**: Show registration completion percentage
2. **Email Preview**: Allow users to see what the verification email looks like
3. **Alternative Verification**: SMS verification as backup option
4. **Social Proof**: Show verification stats ("Join 10,000+ verified users")

### Security Enhancements
1. **IP Tracking**: Log IP addresses for verification attempts
2. **Device Verification**: Optional device-based verification
3. **Suspicious Activity Detection**: Flag unusual registration patterns
4. **Two-Factor Setup**: Encourage 2FA setup after email verification

### Admin Features
1. **Admin Dashboard**: View pending verifications in admin panel
2. **Manual Verification**: Allow admins to manually verify users
3. **Bulk Operations**: Approve/reject multiple pending verifications
4. **Analytics**: Track verification rates and dropout points

### Technical Improvements
1. **Queue Processing**: Move email sending to background jobs
2. **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry for failed email deliveries
3. **Email Templates**: Multiple email template options
4. **Localization**: Multi-language verification emails
5. **webhooks**: Integration with external verification services

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Emails not sending**: Check SMTP configuration and mail logs
2. **Verification links not working**: Verify APP_URL and signed route configuration
3. **Expired tokens**: Users can request new verification emails
4. **Duplicate email errors**: Check both User and PendingUserVerification tables

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check mail configuration
php artisan tinker
>>> Mail::raw('Test', function($msg) { $msg->to('test@example.com')->subject('Test'); });

# Check pending verifications
php artisan auth:pending-status

# Test verification email
php artisan auth:test-verification your-email@example.com
```
