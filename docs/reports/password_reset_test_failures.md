# Password Reset Test Failures Report

## Issue

The password reset tests in `tests/Feature/Auth/PasswordResetTest.php` are failing. The tests are failing because the `ResetPassword` notification is not being sent.

## Analysis

The tests are failing with the error `The expected [Illuminate\Auth\Notifications\ResetPassword] notification was not sent.`. This indicates that the application is not sending the password reset email when it should be.

This is likely a problem with the application code, not the test. The `withoutMiddleware` call was added to the tests to resolve the CSRF token issue, but the tests are still failing.

## Proposed Solution

The password reset logic in `app/Http/Controllers/Auth/PasswordResetLinkController.php` should be reviewed to ensure that it is correctly sending the `ResetPassword` notification.

Specifically, the `store` method should be checked to see if it is correctly handling the password reset request and sending the notification.

It is also possible that the issue is with the mail configuration for the test environment. The `phpunit.xml` file is configured to use the `array` mailer, but it is possible that this is not working as expected.
