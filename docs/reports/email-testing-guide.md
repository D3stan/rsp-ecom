## Important Notes

- No server startup commands (`npm run`, `php artisan serve`)
- No database migrations or installations
- Pure email testing functionality
- Supervisor should handle any dependency installations

üìß **Email Delivery**: Make sure your mail configuration is properly set up in your `.env` file before testing.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
