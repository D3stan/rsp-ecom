# Checkout and Email Fixes - Implementation Guide

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Stripe Checkout Success Page Redirect Issue
- **Problem**: Users were being redirected to homepage instead of success page after payment
- **Root Cause**: The checkout success route was correctly configured, but there might have been issues with session handling or error cases
- **Solution**: Enhanced error handling and logging in the success method to better track issues

### 2. Order Confirmation Email Not Being Sent
- **Problem**: Confirmation emails were not being sent for both registered users and guest orders
- **Root Cause**: The `WebhookServiceProvider` was not registered, so Stripe webhooks weren't being processed
- **Solution**: 
  - Registered `WebhookServiceProvider` in `bootstrap/providers.php`
  - Enhanced email sending logic with better error handling
  - Added fallback email sending in the success page controller
  - Improved logging for debugging

## Changes Made

### 1. Provider Registration
```php
// File: bootstrap/providers.php
return [
    App\Providers\AppServiceProvider::class,
    App\Providers\WebhookServiceProvider::class, // Added this line
];
```

### 2. Enhanced CheckoutController
- Improved error handling in `success()` method
- Added fallback order creation for edge cases
- Enhanced logging for debugging
- Added email sending fallback in success page

### 3. Enhanced EmailService
- Better error handling and logging
- Relationship loading before email sending
- More detailed logging for troubleshooting

### 4. Enhanced StripeWebhookListener
- Better error handling
- Improved logging for webhook processing

### 5. New Commands for Testing and Maintenance
- `TestCheckoutEmail`: Test email functionality
- `SendPendingOrderEmails`: Send emails for orders that missed them

## Testing the Fixes

### Test Email Configuration
```bash
php artisan test:checkout-email your-email@example.com
```

### Test with Existing Order
```bash
php artisan test:checkout-email your-email@example.com --order-id=123
```

### Send Pending Emails (Dry Run)
```bash
php artisan orders:send-pending-emails --dry-run
```

### Send Pending Emails (Actually Send)
```bash
php artisan orders:send-pending-emails
```

### Create Test Order Email
```bash
php artisan send:test-order-confirmation your-email@example.com
```

## Debugging Tips

### 1. Check Logs
```bash
tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log
```

### 2. Check Order Status
In database, check the `orders` table:
- `confirmation_email_sent` should be `true` after email is sent
- `confirmation_email_sent_at` should have a timestamp
- `payment_status` should be `succeeded` for successful payments

### 3. Check Stripe Webhook Events
- Go to Stripe Dashboard â†’ Webhooks
- Check if events are being received
- Look for `checkout.session.completed` and `payment_intent.succeeded` events

### 4. Test Stripe Checkout Flow
1. Add items to cart
2. Go through checkout process
3. Use Stripe test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
4. Complete payment
5. Check if redirected to success page with order details
6. Check if confirmation email is received

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Webhook not being called
- **Check**: Ensure webhook URL is correctly configured in Stripe Dashboard
- **URL should be**: `https://yourdomain.com/stripe/webhook`
- **Events to enable**: `checkout.session.completed`, `payment_intent.succeeded`

### Issue: Email not being sent
- **Check mail configuration** in `.env` file
- **Test mail config**: `php artisan test:checkout-email test@example.com`
- **Check mail logs**: Look in `storage/logs/laravel.log` for email errors

### Issue: Order not found on success page
- **Check**: Session ID is being passed correctly in URL
- **Check**: Stripe session exists and is valid
- **Fallback**: System will create fallback order data if database order creation fails

### Issue: Success page redirects to home
- **Check logs** for error messages
- **Common causes**: Invalid session ID, expired session, Stripe API errors
- **Solution**: Enhanced error messages now provide more context

## Email Template Customization

The email template is located at:
```
resources/views/emails/order-confirmation.blade.php
```

Variables available in the template:
- `$order` - The order object
- `$customer` - The customer (user or guest)
- `$items` - Order items with product details

## Monitoring

Consider setting up monitoring for:
- Failed webhook events
- Orders without confirmation emails
- Email sending failures

Use the `orders:send-pending-emails` command as a daily cron job to catch any missed emails:

```bash
# Add to crontab
0 9 * * * cd /path/to/your/project && php artisan orders:send-pending-emails
```

## Security Notes

- All webhook events are verified using Stripe's signature verification (handled by Laravel Cashier)
- Email sending is rate-limited by Laravel's built-in mechanisms
- Sensitive data is logged with appropriate redaction
